The steps to run the shell application:

1. First ensure that you have a Unix-like operating system (such as Linux, macOS, or WSL on Windows) with a C compiler like gcc installed.
 
2. Begin by creating a project directory where both your source code and Makefile will reside. Inside the project directory, create a file called shell_program.c and place the source code inside it. Additionally, create a Makefile in the same directory with the content provided earlier to automate the compilation process.

3. Once both the source code and Makefile are ready, open a terminal in the project directory and run the make command to compile the program. This will generate an executable called shell. 

4. After the program is successfully compiled, run the shell by typing ./shell in the terminal. You can now enter commands such as ls, pwd, or use features like background execution (sleep 5 &), history (!!), redirection (ls > output.txt), and pipes (ls -l | less). 

5. To exit the shell, type exit. If needed, clean up the compiled files by running make clean. These steps will ensure that your shell program is compiled and executed correctly.
